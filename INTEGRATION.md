# OctetSDK for iOS — Integration Prerequisites

What every consumer app needs to provide for the SDK to start cleanly.
The SDK can't ship most of these on the host's behalf — they live in
the host app bundle by platform mandate.

---

## `Info.plist` keys

Add the following to your app's `Info.plist`. Without them the SDK
crashes on first launch with a privacy-sensitive-data error from the
iOS runtime — the message points at the missing key.

### Required

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses your location to verify and prove your location
to services that request it.</string>

<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses motion data to detect when you're stationary or
moving, which improves the confidence of location proofs.</string>
```

**Why `NSMotionUsageDescription` is non-negotiable:** the SDK's
`MotionStateTracker` instantiates `CMMotionActivityManager` immediately
during `Octet.start(...)`. Apple requires the usage-description key
before any code touches that API, even read-only. Missing the key
produces:

> This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive
> data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain
> an NSMotionUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to
> the user how the app uses this data.

The strings are user-facing — write them in your product's voice; the
copy above is a safe default.

### Required only if you enable background location

If you call `Octet.start(config:)` with an `OctetConfig` that turns on
background location (i.e. you need proofs while the app is
backgrounded), add these too:

```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses background location to continue generating
location proofs while you're not actively using it.</string>

<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>location</string>
</array>
```

Without these the SDK silently falls back to foreground-only operation
when the app is backgrounded; the SDK itself does not crash, but proofs
stop generating until the app returns to foreground. The check happens
internally in the GPS provider: background location updates are only
enabled when both `backgroundLocationEnabled` is configured *and* the
user grants `.authorizedAlways`.

### Future sensors

If the SDK adds new privacy-gated APIs (camera, bluetooth, microphone,
HealthKit), each one drags in its own usage-description key. Re-check
this list when upgrading SDK major versions.

## Sample copy attribution

The English-language strings above are reference copy. You're free to
use them verbatim, translate, or rewrite for your brand. Apple's
review reads these strings; reviewers prefer specific, user-friendly
explanations over generic "to function" boilerplate.

## Reference implementation

The sample app in [`sample/`](sample/) exercises the minimum viable
permission flow if you need a reference.
